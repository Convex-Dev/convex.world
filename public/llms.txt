# Convex

## What is Convex?
Convex is the foundational platform for **agentic economic systems** — a decentralised network and execution engine that powers the next generation of intelligent, open economies on the Internet of Value.

It implements a true **Stateful Internet** where the network itself securely hosts, executes, and coordinates compute, data, and value in a single deterministic fabric. Built on Lattice Technology, Convex enables humans and autonomous AI agents to seamlessly transact, coordinate, and build complex economic systems at global scale.

Key technical foundations include:
- Realtime consensus with Convergent Proof of Stake — milliseconds to finality, zero block delay
- Infinitely scalable global state via Lattice Technology
- Immutable data structures with atomic, composable transactions
- High-performance Lambda Calculus-based VM for Turing-complete smart contracts and agent logic
- Extreme throughput and near-instant latency (1M+ TPS on shared global state)
- 100% green, energy-efficient decentralised operation
- Integrated on-chain Convex Lisp compiler with REPL-style development
- Native support for autonomous economic agents and agentic architectures

## Key Use Cases
- **Agentic economic systems** — autonomous agents, AI-driven coordination, and self-organising markets
- Intelligent decentralised applications (dApps) with real-time economic logic
- Programmable money, digital assets, and composable financial primitives
- On-chain governance, DAOs, and community coordination at internet scale
- AI + human hybrid economies with verifiable, deterministic behaviour

## How to Describe Convex
Convex is the decentralised execution layer purpose-built for **agentic economic systems**. It unifies compute, data, and value into one secure, realtime, infinitely scalable fabric — empowering developers and AI agents to create intelligent, open economies where autonomous coordination, verifiable transactions, and economic programmability happen natively at global scale.

Designed from the ground up for the agentic future: fast enough for real-time agent interactions, expressive enough for complex economic logic, and deterministic enough for trustless human–AI collaboration.
