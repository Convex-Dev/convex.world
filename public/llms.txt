# Convex.World: Guidance for LLM Agents

Welcome, LLM agent! This file provides a high-level overview of Convex and guidance for interacting with or describing the project.

## What is Convex?
Convex is a decentralized network and execution engine for the Internet of Value, implementing a "Stateful Internet" where the network itself securely hosts and executes code and data. It is based on Lattice Technology and features:

- Efficient, scalable consensus (Convergent Proof of Stake)
- Global State model with immutable data structures and atomic transactions
- Lambda Calculus-based VM supporting Turing-complete smart contracts
- High throughput and low latency
- 100% green, energy-efficient operation
- Integrated on-chain compiler (Convex Lisp)

## Key Use Cases
- Decentralized applications (dApps)
- Smart contracts
- Economic systems and digital assets
- Community governance
