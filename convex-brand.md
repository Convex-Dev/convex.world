Introduction
Dear Convex team,
I am delighted to introduce our brand guide, a comprehensive document that expresses the core values,
mission, and personality of our Foundation.
Our brand is much more than just a logo or colour scheme - it represents the heart and soul of our organisation.
It is the way we present our experiences and interact with the world. It is how people will remember us. This
guide serves as a reference and a tool to help us consistently communicate our brand in all of our endeavours.
I encourage you to take the time to read through the guide and familiarise yourself with its contents. Use it as a
resource when creating materials or representing the Convex Foundation in any capacity. Let’s work together
to ensure that our brand is accurately and consistently represented at all times.
Thank you for your commitment to Convex and for helping to build and nurture our brand.
Sincerely,
Mike Anderson

The Convex Platform
We are building fair, inclusive, efficient, and sustainable
economic systems based on decentralised technology
for the 21st century and beyond.
The time is ripe for change: For too long, our societies
have been burdened by inefficient and unfair economic
systems. Monopolistic organisations hold undue power,
exploiting centralised control over important parts of
our economies. Transaction costs are massive, holding
back progress and burdening people with unnecessary
costs. Many people are unfairly excluded from financial
and economic participation. Our economic models
are causing tragic and unsustainable damage to the
natural world we all share.
Convex is a public decentralised network for real-time
value exchange, designed as a substrate for economic
transactions and smart contracts. As such, it provides
the foundation for the type of economics we want to see in the world. The primary purpose of Convex is to
facilitate economic systems: interactions where participants come to agreements where they gain something
of value from each other.
We believe that being able to participate in the economy is a fundamental right. This principle is critical so
that people are able to act freely in the economy without being excluded. We will never use technology or
services that are ecologically unjustifiable. We hope for a world where all economic activity is conducted on a
sustainable basis, and Convex will make important contributions towards that goal.
Convex operates as an open network in the spirit of the original Internet. Convex effectively adds a new
capability to the Internet: a secure, persistent global state machine that can efficiently execute transactions
and enforce smart contracts.

Logo introduction

The Convex logo draws heavily on the use of convex
shapes. A convex shape is a geometric figure that
has a curved surface that bulges outward.
Why convex is important.
Convexity is an important concept in mathematics
because it arises in many different contexts,
such as geometry, optimization, and functional
analysis. In geometry, convex shapes have
useful properties that make them easier to work
with than concave shapes. For example, any line
segment that connects two points on a convex
shape lies entirely within the shape, which means
that convex shapes are “self-contained” in some
sense. This property can be used to prove various
theorems about convex shapes.
In optimization, convexity is important because it
allows for efficient algorithms to find the optimal
solution to certain problems. For example, if the
objective function of an optimization problem
is convex, then it has only one global minimum,
which means that there is only one solution that
is the best possible. This allows for algorithms to
efficiently find the optimal solution without getting
stuck in local minima.
In functional analysis, convexity is important
because it is closely related to the concept of a
“dual space,” which is a mathematical structure
that encodes the geometric properties of a
function. The dual space of a convex function has
a number of useful properties, such as the ability to
efficiently approximate other functions. This makes
convex functions important tools in a variety of
mathematical and computational applications.
Convex is a self-contained algorithim that provides
simple solutions to complex real world problems.
Shape
The Convex logo is based upon the shape of a hexagon and triangles
of which both are convex shapes.
Symbol
The shape is to meant to represent the place were all points
converge forming the building blocks of community & development.
Logo
The complete logo mark is built from the logo symbol combined
with the logotype. The clearspace between the “E” and the “X”
gives a nod to the mathmatic double arrow and hints at the hidden
algorithm of Convex. The spacing in and around the sympbol and log
type form triangular shapes which suggest the space of possibility.
Letters
The logo can also be expressed in letterform only as a logotype
which can stand on its own. The proper usage is for the Symbol,
logo, and logotype are spelled out in the official Brand Guide.
Application on a background

Colored Background color
For use on darker backgrounds, the White version or the Pantone 284C color version should be used. In most scenarios this
will provide a high enough contrast ratio. Note that Pantone 284C any backgrounds other than Black or Pantone 2756C results
in a lower contrast ratio and thus should be used for more of a watermark effect. If the 2 Color White version is used then a
background tint color of 85% will be most effective in achieving a higher contrast ratios. If lower percetage tint color backgrounds
are desired, please consult with the Brand Manager before deploying or replicating. The logo may be placed over images but
should not be placed over other text or any non-brand approved colors.

Logo construction and clear space

Logo guidelines
The official spelling of convex when used in the logo should be in all capitals. Variations and alternate versions of the
logo are allowed and may be that may be used in different contexts. For examle. when the space availabe to place the
logo is horizontal then the official horixontal version should be used. If the available space is more vertically oriented or
if the space is a square or circle, then the vertical lockup version of the logo should be used. LinkedIn and Twitter are
examples of social media were the vertical version should be used.
Construction
A measurement distance of 1 “E” is used to specify the minimum amount of clear space that should
surround the logo. The assending leg of the capital E is used as finer spacing reference. 32 spaces in
total comprise the horizontal logo in its entirety.
Clear Space
A measurement distance of 1 “E” is used to specify the minimum amount of clear space that should
surround the logo. The assending leg of the capital E is used as finer spacing reference. 33 spaces in
total comprise the horizontal logo in its entirety. A minimum of 2 “E” around the entire logo is required.

Color
The primary, secondary,

and tertiary color

systems

The primary color system

Color system
Color is an expression of the brand identity, colors influences consumers. Color attracts consumers and evokes emotions such
as feelings of warmth, security, excitement, curiosity or home. Emotions drive decisions and in reference to brands, that equals
profits. When a brand repeatedly markets with the same color, it strengthens brand awareness. Consistent use of color provides
a common link between departments, sub-brands and products. Therefore, when creating marketing materials it is essential
to choose from the brand colors carefully.
Color palette guidelines
The following pages contain the Convex brand color palette. This is the full range of colors that are used in the Convex identity.
The purpose of this colour pallete is to attract developers and investors.. It reflects the clear, consise approach of Convex as a
solution to real world problems.
Primary, Secondary, Tertiary color
The brand consists of the Primary color system which includes Dark Blue and Medium Blue. Secondary colors are Sky BLue and
Light Blue. Tertiary colors are Apple Green and Rich Yellow. A favorable reference point for the use of tertiary colors is 10% of the
entire color palette. Even though tertiary colors are not used often, they are still useful in adding diversity to the palette. Charts
and graphs are good examples of usage of both secondary and tertiary colors.
Black and white
Black and white can be easily overlooked which is why it is worth noting these colors. Generally, black is used as a text and
background color while white provides contrast and clear spacing. In some cases, like print, companies may want a rich black
and use all four print colors, for example: cyan 40%, magenta 30%, yellow 30% and black 100%. This guide does not specify the
use of a rich black. The prefered approach, if a rich black is desired would be to use the Convex Dark Blue.
For digital use, pure black (#000000) is typically not recommended for backgrounds or text. Pure black overpowers surrounding
objects and is straining on the eye on digital devices. Ultimately, pure black is not user-friendly and should be avoided. An
alternative would be to use #1D1D1B. Percentages of black may also be used. this creates what is known as a Grayscale. The
highest level of gray is black and the lightest shade is white. Incorporating a grayscale, can help support primary colors and
indicats, through design, a hierarchy of importance. Tinted versions of colors may aslo be used as alternatives to grayscales.
This provides a more monochromatic look and can be very effective as well.
Accent color
A secondary color can be featured with a primary color as an accent color. The primary color is still the dominant color but the
secondary color is used in combination to draw attention.
Brand color formats
Colors are communicated in all different types of formats depending on its purpose. Below are the most common color formats.
HEX : hexadecimal
RGB : Red, Green, Blue
CMYK : Cyan Magenta Yellow Key. Key is another term for black.
PMS : Pantone Matching System
HEX
HEX code is the key to unlock web and digital design like HTML, CSS and SCSS. Colors are represented in a 6 number and/or
letters combination. For example, black is #000000 and white is #ffffff.
RGB
RGB is also for digital use including television. For this format, RGB combines red, green and blue to create a spectrum of colors.
For this format, black is 0,0,0 and white is 256,256,256.
CMYK
For print use, CMYK is ideal. Tiny dots of cyan, magenta, yellow and black are overlapped to blend colors. Because of limitations
with a printer, not all colors can be produced. Black is represented as 0,0,0,100 and white is 0,0,0,0. For an even richer black,
cyan and magenta can be added to 100% black, resulting in 50,50,0,100.
PMS
Sometimes referred to as Pantone or Spot Colors, PMS is used for print and textile production. There are variations of Pantone
depending on whether the paper is glossy or coated (Pantone C) and uncoated (Pantone U). In standard Pantone, black is
“PANTONE Black C”. A pure white is nonexistent as the creator assumes the image is printed on white paper

Font
Explanation of a font
A font is a set of characters (letters, numbers, and punctuation marks) that have a specific design and appearance.
Fonts are used in a variety of contexts, such as in printed documents, on websites, and in applications. They are an
important part of a document’s design and layout, and can affect how the document is perceived and read. Different
fonts can have different effects on the reader, such as conveying a sense of formality, informality, elegance, or fun.
This guide includes some basic guidelines for how the fonts should be combined with other elements, such as images
and graphics, to create a cohesive and consistent brand image.
The impact of using san serif fonts verse serif
Convex uses only sans serif fonts as compared to serifed fonts which are considered to be more traditional and formal
than san serif fonts. These are fonts that do not have the small decorative lines at the ends of characters, known as
“serifs.” Serif fonts, on the other hand, do have serifs.
In general, san serif fonts are considered to be more modern and minimalist than serif fonts, and may be seen as more
informal and approachable. When used in digital contexts, such as on websites and in applications, they can be easily
read on screens. San serif fonts may also be seen as more versatile, as they can be used in a wider range of sizes and
contexts without losing legibility.
Optimal font size for websites
There is no single “optimal” font size for websites or for mobile, as the appropriate font size will depend on the specific
design and layout of the website, as well as the preferences and needs of the target audience.
In general, it is recommended that the font size for body text on a website be at least 16 pixels and at least 14px for
mobile, to ensure that it is legible on a wide range of devices and screen sizes. Larger font sizes may be used for
headings and other elements that are intended to attract attention or to be easily scanned by the reader.
It is also important to consider the readability of the font at different sizes, as well as the overall design and layout of
the website. The font size should be large enough to be easily readable, but not so large that it dominates the page or
creates an overcrowded or cluttered appearance. The font size should also be consistent across the website, to create
a cohesive and professional look.
In addition to the font size, other factors that can affect the readability of text on a website include the font family, the
line height, the letter spacing, and the color contrast between the text and the background. These factors should also
be considered when choosing the font size for a website.
Convex Fonts
The main Convex corporate font is Inter. Inter is an Open Source font. This font should be used for all main headlines
and should be title case. Avoid setting headlines in all caps. The secondary font is Source Sans Variable. As an
alternative substitute, Source Sans Pro may be used if Source Sans Variable is not available. This font shuld be used
for all body text inlcluding subheadings, footnotes, quotes, etc. A minimum font size of 12pt with ‘Auto line spacing’
and 11pt ‘After paragraph’ spacing should be used by default. Certain exeptions such as footnotes, etc. may require a
smaller font size.

Compliance
AA Compliance

Compliance
AA Compliant font / color systems

The system
AA compliance refers to the requirement that a document or other material must be made accessible to people with disabilities,
in accordance with the AA level of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) published by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C). The WCAG provide a set of standards and recommendations for making web content more accessible to people with
disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.
AA compliance is the second-highest level of compliance with the WCAG, and it requires that a document or other material
must be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust, so that it can be used by people with disabilities. This means that
the document must be designed in a way that makes it easy for people with disabilities to perceive the information it contains,
navigate its structure, understand its meaning, and interact with it using assistive technologies.
To achieve AA compliance, a document must meet a number of specific criteria, such as providing text alternatives for images,
using sufficient contrast between text and background colors, providing clear and simple language, and using headings and
other structural elements to organize the content. The document must also be tested for accessibility by people with disabilities
to ensure that it meets their needs.
AA compliance is important because it helps ensure that people with disabilities can access and use information and services
that are available online. It also helps organizations meet their legal obligations to provide equal access to information and
services to people with disabilities.
The following systems have been checked with the AA checker and have been found to have a contrast ratio of 7:1 or higher.
This is a compliant ratio. As can be seen on dark backgrounds, white provides the highest contrast ratio. The same is true in the
reverse. When using a colored background, the dark blue Pantone 2756C provides the highest contrast ratio. Black can be used
but blue is preferred. When designing marketing materials, please reference https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/ to
download a compliance checker. These systems should be taken into consideration when designing any marketing materials
for print or web. In some cases the contrast ratio may fall below the target ratio as in the case of non-critical items.

Stationary

Corporate stationary
Stationary refers to the written communications
and materials used by an individual or organization,
such as letterhead, envelopes, and business
cards. This broad term encompasses the various
elements of the Convex visual identity.
Stationary typically includes the name and contact
information of the person or organization, as well
as any logos, graphics, or other elements that are
associated with the brand. It is used for a wide
range of purposes, such as correspondence,
invitations, proposals, and presentations.
The design and layout of stationary are important
because they help to establish the visual identity
of the person or organization, and can create
a professional and cohesive image. The design
should be consistent across all materials, and
should reflect the values, goals, and personality of
the person or organization.

The grid system
The grid system is the framework that is used
to organize and align content on a page. It is an
important tool for creating well-structured and
balanced layouts, and can help to ensure that the
elements on the page are aligned and organized in
a consistent and logical manner.
The grid system establishes a hierarchy of
