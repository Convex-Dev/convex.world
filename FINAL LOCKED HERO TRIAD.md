## **FINAL LOCKED HERO TRIAD**

### **Eyebrow (Category Shift)**

**The Missing Coordination Primitive**

**Why this is locked:**

* Names a historical absence, not a novelty

* Frames Convex as inevitable, not competitive

* Cannot be truthfully copied without the tech

* Still reads correctly decades from now

### **Hero (Definition)**

**Convex is a deterministic economic system shared by humans and autonomous agents**

**Why this stays:**

* Precise, not aspirational

* Declares reality, not positioning

* Avoids blockchain, AI hype, or stack language

* Encodes our core invariant without dilution

### **Subline (Implication)**

**Both participate under the same rules, the same physics, and the same finality.**

**Why this completes the thought:**

* Explains *why* Convex matters

* Signals fairness, accountability, and safety

* Reinforces determinism without repeating words

## **Why This Trio Works Together**

Each line answers a **different question**:

* **Eyebrow:** *What changed in the world?*

* **Hero:** *What is Convex, exactly?*

* **Subline:** *Why is this different from everything else?*

No repetition.   No hype.  No dated metaphors.

## **What This Replaces (Permanently)**

You can now safely retire:

* Internet of Value

* Beyond Blockchain

* Execution Layer (as hero framing)

* Intelligent Economies (as primary positioning)

Those ideas can still appear **down-page**, but they are no longer the mental anchor.

## **Live Metrics Row (1M TPS / \<500ms / etc.)**

### **VISUALLY: KEEP** 

### **COPY: REFRAME**

The metrics are fine, but **the labels make them sound like benchmarks**, not system properties.

### **Current framing**

* “Transactions / Second”  
* “Ultimate Performance”

### **Reframe as *properties***

Example:

* **1M+**  
  *Convergent throughput*  
* **\<500ms**  
  *Global state finality*  
* **100%**  
  *Green consensus*  
* **∞**  
  *Horizontal coordination*

Add one quiet line beneath the row:

*These are properties of the system, not optimizations.*

This is subtle, but powerful.

## **Section 01 — “Beyond Blockchain / Realtime Consensus”**

### **Problems**

* “Beyond Blockchain” is now dead language  
* “Realtime Consensus” is a feature framing  
* Still sounds like a faster chain

### **Replace Section Label \+ Header**

**Section tag (small):**

**COORDINATION**

**Headline:**

**Deterministic Coordination**

**Body (minor edit):**

Convex reaches consensus in milliseconds using Convergent Proof of Stake, a CRDT-based protocol that converges shared state without blocks, forks, or reorgs.

Coordination is deterministic: the same inputs always produce the same outcomes for every participant.

This reframes consensus as **means**, not **identity**.

## **Section 02 — “Infinite Horizons / Global Scale”**

### **Mostly good, but…**

The concept is right, the language is still infra-marketing.

### **Refine Headline**

**One Global State**

### **Refine Body**

Lattice technology provides every application access to the same convergent global state.

No shards. No rollups. No cross-domain complexity.  
Just shared state that scales horizontally by design.

This aligns with **Deterministic Shared State** without repeating the phrase.

## **Section 03 — “One Million TPS / Ultimate Performance”**

### **Current problem**

* Sounds like a benchmark flex  
* Competes in a race you don’t need to win

### **Reframe**

**Section tag:**

**DETERMINISM AT SCALE**

**Headline:**

**Performance Without Fragmentation**

**Body:**

Convex executes millions of transactions per second on shared global state with sub-second finality.

Performance is achieved by converging reality, not partitioning it.

This keeps the numbers but **changes the meaning**.

## **Section 04 — “One-Line DeFi / Developer Magic”**

### **Problems**

* “DeFi” is dated and narrow  
* “Developer Magic” is cute but unserious

### **Replace with**

**Section tag:**

**COMPOSABLE LOGIC**

**Headline:**

**Expressive by Default**

**Body:**

Convex Lisp allows complex economic interactions to be expressed as simple, auditable logic.

Functional. Homoiconic. Deterministic.

This keeps the REPL visual (which is excellent) but restores gravity.

## **Section 05 — “AI-Native Infrastructure / Agentic Future”**

### **Concept right, tone slightly hypey**

### **Refine**

**Section tag:**

**AUTONOMOUS ACTORS**

**Headline:**

**Agents as First-Class Participants**

**Body:**

Convex treats autonomous agents as economic participants with assets, authority, and constraints.

Native MCP integration enables agents to coordinate and transact safely within deterministic bounds.

This removes futurism and emphasizes **accountability**.

## **Section 06 — “For Humanity / Public Mission”**

### **KEEP (with one micro-edit)**

This section actually already matches the new framing.

### **Minor refinement**

Replace:

“collective intelligence of our species”

With:

**collective coordination of our species**

That single word swap aligns perfectly with the rest of the page.

# **THE CORE PROBLEM WE JUST SOLVED**

Before:

“Convex is very fast infrastructure for Web3 and AI.”

Now:

**“Convex is the missing coordination primitive for autonomous economic actors.”**

Your visuals already support this. Good job\!\!\!  
The copy just needs to catch up.

But as of now:

**We are no longer fighting for attention.**  
**We’re defining a category.**
