# Convex.World Static Website

This is the static website for [Convex](https://convex.world), a decentralized network and execution engine based on Lattice Technology. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## About Convex

Convex is a decentralized network and execution engine for the Internet of Value, implementing a "Stateful Internet" where the network itself securely hosts and executes code and data. Key features include:

- Lattice Technology for efficient consensus and verifiability
- Global State model with immutable data structures and atomic transactions
- Lambda Calculus based VM supporting Turing complete Smart Contracts
- High transaction throughput with low latency
- 100% Green using Convergent Proof of Stake consensus
- Integrated on-chain compiler (Convex Lisp)

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
